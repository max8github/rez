# Multi-Agent System

A sample application demonstrating how to build a multi-agent system using Akka and an LLM model.

## Overview

This project illustrates an Agentic workflow for a multi-agent system using Akka. The system:

- Processes user queries and determines the appropriate agents to handle the request
- Plans the execution order of the selected agents
- Executes the plan by interacting with the agents in sequence
- Summarizes the results from all agents into a final response

### Akka components

This sample leverages specific Akka components:

- **Workflow**: Manages the user query process, handling the sequential steps of agent selection, plan creation, execution, and summarization.
- **EventSourced Entity**: Maintains the session memory, storing the sequence of interactions between the user and the system.
- **HTTP Endpoint**: Serves the application endpoints for interacting with the multi-agent system (`/activities`).

### Other

- **LLM model**: The system uses an LLM model to assist in agent selection, plan creation, and summarization. The LLM is integrated with tools specific to each agent's domain of expertise.

## Example flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant HTTPEndpoint as HTTP Endpoint
    participant Workflow as Akka Workflow
    participant Selector as Agent Selector
    participant Planner as Execution Planner
    participant WeatherAgent as Weather Agent
    participant ActivityAgent as Activity Agent
    participant Summarizer as Summarizer

    User->>HTTPEndpoint: "I do not work today. I am in Madrid. What should I do? Beware of the weather"
    HTTPEndpoint->>Workflow: Create new workflow instance
    Note over Workflow: Initialize multi-agent query process
    HTTPEndpoint-->>User: Return activity id for follow up 

    Workflow->>Selector: Select appropriate agents
    Selector-->>Workflow: Return selected agents (e.g., WeatherAgent, ActivityAgent)

    Workflow->>Planner: Create execution plan
    Planner-->>Workflow: Return ordered plan (e.g., WeatherAgent -> ActivityAgent)

    loop Execute plan
        Workflow->>WeatherAgent: "What is the weather in Madrid?"
        WeatherAgent-->>Workflow: "Rainy in Madrid"

        Workflow->>ActivityAgent: "Suggest activities for a day in Madrid"
        ActivityAgent-->>Workflow: "Visit the Prado Museum or enjoy local cafes"
    end

    Workflow->>Summarizer: Summarize responses
    Summarizer-->>Workflow: "The weather in Madrid is rainy today, so you might want to explore indoor attractions..."

    User->>HTTPEndpoint: Send query by session id
    HTTPEndpoint->>Workflow: Request result from workflow
    Workflow-->>HTTPEndpoint: Return result
    HTTPEndpoint-->>User: Deliver response
```

Note that the agents selected depend on the user's query and the available agents. Thus, the flow varies arbitrarily depending on the Planner agent reasoning and the steps selected to respond to the query. Also, another important aspect is that all agents share the same context and thus, when answering a question can take into consideration the context of the previous interactions with other agents. 

## Running the application

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- A [Secure Repository Token](https://account.akka.io/token)

### Build and run

---

### Secure Repository Token

Building requires a secure repository token, which is set up as part of [Akka CLI](https://doc.akka.io/getting-started/quick-install-cli.html)'s `akka code init` command.

If you still need to configure your system with the token there are two additional ways:

1. Use the Akka CLI's `akka code token` command and follow the instructions.
2. Set up the token manually as described [here](https://account.akka.io/token).

---

To run the application, you need to provide the following environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key. If you prefer to use a different LLM model, follow the instructions in `application.conf` to change it.
- `WEATHER_API_KEY`: (Optional) API key for the weather service

Set the environment variables:

- On Linux or macOS:

  ```shell
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
  export WEATHER_API_KEY=your-weather-api-key
  ```

- On Windows (command prompt):

  ```shell
  set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
  set WEATHER_API_KEY=your-weather-api-key
  ```

Build and run the application:
```shell
# Run the application
mvn compile exec:java
```

### Testing the agents

With the application running, you can test the system using the following endpoints:

* Start a new session:
```shell
curl -i -XPOST --location "http://localhost:9000/activities/alice/1" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"message": "I do not work tomorrow. I am in Madrid. What should I do? Beware of the weather"}'
```

The system will process the query, select the appropriate agents, and return a response.

* Retrieve the response for a specific session:
```shell
curl -i -XGET --location "http://localhost:9000/activities/alice/1"
```

You can also retrieve for all previous suggestions for a user:

```shell
curl -i -XGET --location "http://localhost:9000/activities/alice"
```

Preferences can be added with:

```shell
curl -i localhost:9000/preferences/alice \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -XPOST \
  --data '{
    "preference": "I like outdoor activities."
  }'
```

## Deployment

You can use the [Akka Console](https://console.akka.io) to create a project and deploy this service.

Build container image:
```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
Install the `akka` CLI as documented in [Install Akka CLI](https://doc.akka.io/operations/cli/installation.html).

Set up secret containing OpenAI API key:
```shell
akka secret create generic agent-secrets \
  --literal openai-key=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
  --literal weather-key=$WEATHER_API_KEY
```

Deploy the service using the image tag from above `mvn install` and the secrets:
```shell
akka service deploy multi-agent multi-agent:<tag-name> --push \
  --secret-env OPENAI_API_KEY=agent-secrets/openai-key \
  --secret-env WEATHER_API_KEY=agent-secrets/weather-key
```

Refer to [Deploy and manage services](https://doc.akka.io/operations/services/deploy-service.html)
for more information.

To understand the Akka concepts that are the basis for this example, see [Development Process](https://doc.akka.io/concepts/development-process.html) in the documentation.
