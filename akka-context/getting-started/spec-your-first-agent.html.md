# Spec-first hello agent

This guide builds a "hello world" greeting agent with spec-driven development. The agent greets each user in a new language every turn and tracks the languages it has already used in the session.

Spec-driven development runs in two modes, and you can build this agent either way. Choose your style below.

## <a href="about:blank#_choose_your_style"></a> Choose your style

- **[À la carte mode](../sdk/a-la-carte-mode.html)** (the default) — you run each specification command yourself, one at a time. Faster and lighter; you own the rigor. Follow [Build À la carte](about:blank#a-la-carte).
- **[Enforced mode](../sdk/enforced-mode.html)** — you define "done" as machine-checkable exit conditions and the assistant drives the build until they are met. A cleaner, auditable result. Follow [Build in Enforced mode](about:blank#enforced).
New installs start in **À la carte** mode. To use Enforced, switch first:

```none
/akka:mode enforced
```

## <a href="about:blank#_prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

- Complete [Set up your AI harness](set-up-dev-env.html#_set_up_your_ai_harness) — install the Akka Specify Plugin and run `/akka:setup`.
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). The application code calls OpenAI, independently of your AI coding assistant. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment before starting your assistant; on Mac/Linux use `export` so child processes inherit it.

## <a href="about:blank#enforced"></a> Build in Enforced mode

Enforced mode is opt-in; switch to it first (new installs default to À la carte):

```none
/akka:mode enforced
```
In Enforced mode you drive the whole build through one re-entrant command, `/akka:specify`, instead of running `clarify`, `plan`, `tasks`, and `implement` individually — `/akka:specify` sequences those phases for you.

### <a href="about:blank#_specify_the_feature"></a> Specify the feature

| **/akka:specify** greeter agent - *greet each user in a new language every turn, remembering which languages were used per session* |
The engine infers a **definition of done** from your intent and Akka’s own surfaces, and shows it grouped by tier — Product, Project, and Process. Some conditions are guaranteed by the platform, some are the machine’s to build, some need a receipt from an external system, and a few need a decision from you. Prohibitions — the conditions that must never become true — print in a separate `NEVER` section:

```none

```
Every condition is in one of three [states](../reference/specify/exit-condition-states.html): `open`, `green`, or `red`. An `open` condition carries a reason: `needs-user-action` (a person on this project can move it forward) or `blocked-outside-project` (a required tool is missing, or a receipt from an external system is required). The two locked (🔒) process-integrity conditions — `PROC-AUDITOR-COVERAGE` and `PROC-ADEQUACY-REVIEWED` — are always on and cannot be struck; they make the verification apparatus check itself. See [Definition-of-Done types](../sdk/enforced-mode.html#dod-types) for what each tier covers.

### <a href="about:blank#_answer_the_open_conditions"></a> Answer the open conditions

Enforced mode reports `NOT_READY` while any condition is `open`. The engine ends every turn with a definitive verdict and the exact next command, and calls out the conditions that need action from you:

```none
NOT_READY — an action to close before I can build:
  • Code & Test Health — coverage threshold?     I suggest 80%
NEXT → /akka:specify <your answer>
```
Answer in your own words — accept the suggestion or set your own:

| **/akka:specify** keep the suggested 80% coverage threshold |
The engine records your decisions, locks the definition of done, and starts building.

### <a href="about:blank#_let_the_build_run"></a> Let the build run

The machine derives the exit conditions, wires [auditors](../sdk/enforced-mode.html#auditors), plans, implements, and loops until every locally runnable condition is `green`. It reports `NOT_READY` and interrupts only if it cannot reach a condition, hits an unresolved ambiguity, or finds a conflict with the organization’s policy.

```none
NOT_READY — 17 applicable conditions
  plan → tasks → implement → verify
  ✓ OPS-COMPILES   ✓ FUNC-TESTS-PASS 6/6   ✓ ENV-DEPS-RESOLVE
NEXT → wait, or /akka:status
```
Check progress at any time without interrupting the build with `/akka:status`.

### <a href="about:blank#_add_a_check_with_feedback"></a> Add a check with feedback

`/akka:specify` is re-entrant: send it plain-language feedback at any time and it materializes the change as a new exit condition with a covering auditor. Ask for a compile-clean guarantee on every build:

| **/akka:specify** every build must compile with no errors before it ships |
The engine adds one exit condition and wires an *introspective* auditor — an inline command that inspects the working tree directly, delegating to the project’s own toolchain. Here that is `mvn -q compile`, whose non-zero exit is the red verdict:

```none
+ Code & Test Health — build compiles clean ........ auditor: mvn -q compile
```
Adding an auditor recomputes the two locked process-integrity gates. Check them with `/akka:status`:

```none
NOT_READY — 18 applicable conditions
  ✓ PROC-AUDITOR-COVERAGE   every build surface has a covering auditor
  ○ PROC-ADEQUACY-REVIEWED  adversarial review re-running for the new check
NEXT → wait, or /akka:status
```
`PROC-ADEQUACY-REVIEWED` re-runs because the set of checks changed; once the review clears, the gate turns `green`.

### <a href="about:blank#_ship"></a> Ship

When every applicable condition is `green` and not stale, the engine reports `READY_TO_SHIP`:

```none
READY_TO_SHIP — every applicable condition is green
  18 conditions · 15 auditor-verified · 3 platform-guaranteed
  ✓ PROC-AUDITOR-COVERAGE   ✓ PROC-ADEQUACY-REVIEWED
NEXT → /akka:ship
```
Run `/akka:ship release`. It runs the auditors for every applicable exit condition at any tier one last time, then runs the ship steps your organization declared for a release ship, and writes a [conformance receipt](../sdk/enforced-mode.html#shipping) recording what was verified.

## <a href="about:blank#a-la-carte"></a> Build À la carte

In À la carte mode you run each command yourself. It is the default, so no switch is needed unless you previously moved to Enforced.

### <a href="about:blank#_specify_the_feature_2"></a> Specify the feature

Run `/akka:specify` with the feature description:

| **/akka:specify** greeter agent - *The greeter agent generates greetings in different languages using an LLM. The consumer of the agent supplies a name and some greeting text in their native language. The agent will then respond with a friendly greeting in English. Each subsequent message sent by a given user will result in a greeting in a randomly chosen language that hasn’t yet been used in that agent session.* |
Approve the MCP tool calls when prompted. The assistant creates a new git branch (`001-greeter-agent`), writes the specification file, and summarizes what the spec covers:

- User Story 1 (P1): first greeting always in English, personalized with the user’s name
- User Story 2 (P1): subsequent greetings in randomly chosen, non-repeating languages per session
- User Story 3 (P2): session isolation — independent language tracking across sessions
- 7 functional requirements, 4 success criteria, 4 edge cases
If the summary does not match your intent, re-run `/akka:specify` with a revised prompt. For a single-feature application like this, skip `/akka:clarify`.

### <a href="about:blank#_create_a_plan"></a> Create a plan

Run `/akka:plan` with the technical implementation prompt. The plan defines *how* to implement the specification — architecture, components, and constraints:

| **/akka:plan** The greeter application is a single RESTful endpoint that exposes a `/greet` route. This accepts a JSON payload with the `user` and `text` fields, which are then incorporated into the user message sent to the OpenAI model. This service has no authentication or other guardrails. Session history for agent conversations is to be implemented using the default and provided agent session support in the SDK. The system prompt for the greeter agent should include the following points without modification:

* You are a cheerful AI assistant with a passion for teaching greetings in new languages

* Start the response with a greeting in a specific language

* Always append the language you’re using in parenthesis in English. E.g. "Hola (Spanish)"

* The first greeting should be in English

* In subsequent interactions the greeting should be in a different language than the ones used before

* After the greeting phrase, add one or a few sentences in English

* Try to relate the response to previous interactions to make it a meaningful conversation

* Always respond with enthusiasm and warmth

* Add a touch of humor or wordplay when appropriate

* At the end, append a list of previous greetings

This implementation should result in a single agent, the `HelloWorldAgent`, and a single endpoint, the `HelloWorldEndpoint`. There are no domain objects nor are there any entity components. The application should obtain its model target configuration from the standard Akka SDK model provider configuration. If insufficient configuration is provided, then the endpoint request should fail with a 500 error code. |
Results vary between runs. The assistant works on branch `001-greeter-agent` and generates these artifacts:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `specs/001-greeter-agent/plan.md` | Implementation plan and component design |
| `specs/001-greeter-agent/research.md` | Decisions on memory, model config, and errors |
| `specs/001-greeter-agent/data-model.md` | API record types only (no entities) |
| `specs/001-greeter-agent/contracts/http-api.md` | HTTP API contract for `POST /greet` |
| `specs/001-greeter-agent/quickstart.md` | Build, run, and test instructions |
The architecture summary describes:

- `HelloWorldAgent` — a single Akka Agent with the verbatim system prompt, SDK session memory, and a config-driven model provider
- `HelloWorldEndpoint` — `POST /greet` taking `{"user","text"}`, using `user` as the session ID, returning 500 on model-config failure
- No domain objects, entities, or views — a pure agent plus endpoint
- Tests — an agent unit test (`TestModelProvider`) and an endpoint integration test (`httpClient`)
All four constitution principles pass: Akka SDK First, Design Principles, Test Coverage, and Simplicity. No code has been written yet.

### <a href="about:blank#_generate_tasks"></a> Generate tasks

Run `/akka:tasks` to convert the plan into an ordered task list. The assistant marks which tasks can run in parallel:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Total tasks | 8 |
| Phase 1 (Setup) | 1 task — `application.conf` |
| Phase 2 (Foundational) | 1 task — `HelloWorldAgent` |
| Phase 3 (US1 & US2 — MVP) | 3 tasks — endpoint + 2 tests |
| Phase 4 (US3) | 1 task — session isolation test |
| Phase 5 (Polish) | 2 tasks — README + quickstart validation |
T004 and T005 can run in parallel after T003; T007 and T008 can run in parallel. The MVP (User Stories 1 and 2) is functional after the first five tasks.

### <a href="about:blank#_implement_the_agent"></a> Implement the agent

Run `/akka:implement` and approve the operations it requests. Expect the assistant to hit compilation or test failures and correct them on its own; step in only if it stops converging after repeated attempts. To change the result, re-run `/akka:implement` with a different model or effort level.

| Task | Status | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T001 | Done | `src/main/resources/application.conf` |
| T002 | Done | `src/main/java/com/example/application/HelloWorldAgent.java` |
| T003 | Done | `src/main/java/com/example/api/HelloWorldEndpoint.java` |
| T004 | Done | `src/test/java/com/example/application/HelloWorldAgentTest.java` |
| T005 | Done | `src/test/java/com/example/api/HelloWorldEndpointIntegrationTest.java` |
| T006 | Done | session isolation test (in T005’s file) |
| T007 | Done | `README.md` |
| T008 | Done | build verified via `mvn verify` |
All four tests pass (1 agent unit, 3 endpoint integration) and `mvn verify` succeeds.

Exercise the application before reviewing the code. If it does not meet the requirements, re-run `/akka:plan` or `/akka:specify` and regenerate. Do not merge the feature branch to `main` until you have exercised the result.

### <a href="about:blank#_exercise_the_agent_api"></a> Exercise the agent API

Run `/akka:build`. This compiles the project, runs the tests, starts the service, and issues a sample request to the endpoint. The AI picks a default port for the service, usually port `9000`.

| Step | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Compilation | PASS |
| Tests | 4 passed, 0 failed |
| Local service | Running on `localhost:9000` |
The endpoint is available at `POST http://localhost:9000/greet`. Test it with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/greet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user": "Maria", "text": "Buenos dias, soy Maria"}'
```

|  | Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` for live LLM responses. Without it, the request returns a 500 as designed. |
