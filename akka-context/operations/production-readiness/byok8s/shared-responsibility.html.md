# Shared responsibility model

This page describes how responsibilities are divided between Akka and the customer when running Akka Automated Operations (AAO) inside a Kubernetes cluster the customer provides and operates, under the BYOK8s (Bring Your Own Kubernetes) deployment model.

|  | The policies published on [trust.akka.io](https://trust.akka.io/) and the Customer Support Policy take precedence over any summary here. |

## <a href="about:blank#_executive_summary"></a> Executive summary

Akka Automated Operations is a managed platform. Under the BYOK8s model, Akka runs inside a Kubernetes cluster the customer provides and operates. Akka takes responsibility for the platform itself: the runtime, operators, inter-component mTLS, region installation, scaling, patching, observability of the platform, and the operational rituals that surround them. Encryption of customer data (database at rest and in transit, ingress TLS) is the customer’s responsibility (see the Encryption section). The customer takes responsibility for the cloud account, the Kubernetes cluster and its underlying infrastructure, database backups, the network, the human identities that access the Akka console, the applications built with the Akka SDK, and the data those applications process.

Because Akka runs inside infrastructure the customer operates, the model is genuinely shared. Akka manages the platform layer end-to-end; the customer manages the layers above and below it; a number of activities are jointly owned with the lead and consulted parties named explicitly.

|  | **What you own in BYOK8s** In BYOK8s you own the infrastructure beneath the platform, not just the application. Beyond the application, you own:

  - The **Kubernetes cluster**: creation, node pools, capacity and scaling, patching, and version upgrades.
  - The **database**: provisioning, capacity, version upgrades, backups, and restores.
  - The **network and ingress**: connectivity, ingress TLS (provide a certificate issuer or grant Akka DNS access), and IP allowlists.
  - The **Teleport proxy** the Federation Plane uses to reach the cluster: install, upgrade, and operational health.
  - **Encryption of your data** at rest and in transit (database and ingress).
  - **Cluster and node audit logs** (the Kubernetes and infrastructure layer you operate).
  - For **Business Continuity** (multi-region): standing up and operating a cluster, database, and cross-region networking in each region.
Akka owns the platform layer: the runtime, operators, inter-component mTLS, region installation, scaling logic, platform observability, and releases. |
Shared responsibility extends to going live. Akka has a set of standards it expects of customer applications before flipping prod traffic on: sizing, observability, CI/CD, functional and non-functional testing, DR (disaster recovery) and rollback rehearsal. The [production readiness checklist](checklist.html) captures those standards and the sign-off gate Akka recommends before launch.

|  | **Catch-all** Anything not explicitly listed in this document is the customer’s responsibility. This includes customer application code, customer-side operational tooling, and any concern not explicitly assigned to Akka. The customer may request additional operational support from Akka through the standard support channel. |

## <a href="about:blank#_layered_view_of_akka_on_byok8s"></a> Layered view of Akka on BYOK8s

The customer owns the applications and the underlying cloud account, Kubernetes cluster, and database; Akka runs inside that cluster and manages the platform components.

| Layer | Owner | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer Applications (Akka SDK services) | Customer | Source, build, deploy; service config and secrets; app ACLs / IAM (JWTs); app observability / SDK logs |
| Akka Platform (managed by Akka, deployed into the customer’s cluster) | Akka | Akka runtime and operators; inter-component mTLS; scaling, patching, releases; Federation Plane integration; platform observability |
| Cloud Account, Kubernetes cluster, and database | Customer | Billing, quotas, dedicated cloud account; Kubernetes cluster (creation, upgrades, capacity); database (creation, upgrades, backups); IAM that grants Akka access into the cluster; CIDR allocation, peering, DNS, IP allowlists; customer-managed KMS keys, cloud audit logs |

## <a href="about:blank#_how_to_read_this"></a> How to read this

Each activity in the matrix has an owner, the party that is Responsible and Accountable. The other party may be Consulted or Informed; called out in the description where relevant.

| Owner | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Customer | The customer is Responsible and Accountable for the activity. Akka may be Consulted or Informed. |
| Akka | Akka is Responsible and Accountable for the activity. The customer may be Consulted or Informed. |
| Shared | Akka and the customer share responsibility. The split is described in the row’s description. |
Because Akka operates inside infrastructure you control, coordinate with Akka before infrastructure changes that could affect the Region.

Reaching the reliability and availability your deployment is built for depends on both sides meeting the responsibilities below, worked through with your Akka team; your agreement and the Federation Plane SLA Policy remain the authoritative statement of what is committed. See the [production readiness overview](../index.html) and the [BYOK8s production readiness checklist](checklist.html).

**Responsibilities**
<!-- </summary> -->

| Activity | Owner | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud account provisioning | Customer | Customer sets up a dedicated AWS account, GCP project, or Azure subscription that hosts the Kubernetes cluster Akka runs in. A dedicated account is recommended to simplify cost tracking and security boundaries; Akka advises against provisioning other resources in it to avoid management conflicts, and anything the customer adds outside this scope is the customer’s responsibility. |
| Quotas and service limits | Customer | Customer ensures sufficient quota for compute, storage, and networking. Akka advises on expected consumption. |
| Billing | Customer | Customer owns and operates the account and pays the bill. |

<!-- </details> -->

## <a href="about:blank#_2_networking_and_connectivity"></a> 2. Networking and connectivity

Akka creates the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and all in-region networking using cloud-provider best practices. The customer provides the CIDR range and owns the surrounding network: peering or hub-and-spoke topologies, IP allowlists, DNS, and any private-connectivity bridge to the corporate network.

At a glance
- **Akka**: Builds the in-region VPC, load balancers, and certificate issuer. Publishes the connectivity-pattern whitepaper so the customer can choose.
- **Customer**: Allocates the CIDR block, configures peering or hub-and-spoke to the corporate network, maintains IP allowlists and DNS records.

| Private ingress/egress | Akka | Where private connectivity is selected, Akka installs the region using the chosen pattern, with an automatically generated load-balancer IP so internal traffic does not traverse the public internet. |
| CIDR allocation | Customer | Customer assigns an appropriately sized CIDR block, especially where peering or hub-and-spoke is required. |
| VPC peering / hub-and-spoke | Customer | Customer configures peering or hub-and-spoke between the Akka region’s VPC and other corporate networks. Availability depends on cloud provider. |
| IP allowlist on NAT and load balancers | Customer | Customer configures and maintains the IP allowlist for the NAT (Network Address Translation) gateways and the public load balancer. The customer informs Akka of changes that may affect Platform connectivity. |
| DNS records | Customer | Customer creates and maintains DNS records for platform machinery and applications in the cloud-provider DNS zones configured by Akka. |

<!-- </details> -->

## <a href="about:blank#_3_platform_setup_and_bootstrap"></a> 3. Platform setup and bootstrap

Akka installs the platform machinery into the Kubernetes cluster the customer has provisioned, federates it to the Akka Federation Plane, and runs smoke tests before handing it over.

At a glance
- **Akka**: Installs the platform machinery (Akka runtime, operators, observability) into the customer’s cluster and configures region groups.
- **Customer**: Provisions the cluster and database, installs Teleport for federation using the short-lived token Akka provides, identifies region groupings, and provides a preferred maintenance window that Akka aims to use for operations that may cause downtime.

Vulnerability reports available from trust.akka.io. |
| Kubernetes and database upgrades | Customer | The customer schedules and runs Kubernetes and database upgrades. The customer must consult Akka in advance so that Akka can certify the target versions against the Platform. Running an unverified version may break Platform functionality and is the customer’s responsibility. |
| Releases (runtime, region machinery, Federation Plane) | Akka | Akka schedules regular releases to installations covering the Akka runtime, region machinery, and Federation Plane components. |

<!-- </details> -->

## <a href="about:blank#_5_operations_and_scaling"></a> 5. Operations and scaling

Akka elastically scales the application workloads to match traffic, within the region’s sizing standards; this depends on the customer ensuring the underlying cluster and database have capacity headroom. The customer retains visibility and control over cost and capacity decisions with business impact.

At a glance
- **Akka**: Auto-provisions and de-provisions compute and persistence to match utilization. HA (high availability) is the default. Triages and prioritizes customer feature requests.
- **Customer**: Reviews their cloud-account spend, selects sizing options, and signals expected demand spikes (e.g., performance testing) so Akka can pre-warm.

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary> -->
**Responsibilities**
<!-- </summary> -->

| Activity | Owner | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost controls | Customer | Customer reviews their cloud-account subscription and monthly charges. Akka auto-provisions and de-provisions to match utilization; HA is the default posture; sizing options keep cost in check. |
| Infrastructure scalability | Customer | Customer is responsible for ensuring scalability of the underlying infrastructure, including compute capacity for node pools and database scaling. |
| Application elasticity | Akka | Akka dynamically adds and removes compute and persistence to accommodate real-time traffic against the customer’s performance SLA (Service Level Agreement) targets. This elasticity is contingent on the customer ensuring sufficient cluster compute and database capacity headroom (see Infrastructure scalability). |
| Region decommission | Shared | On customer request (end of contract, scope change, topology adjustment), Akka follows the documented decommissioning runbook to gracefully remove the region from the Federation Plane and clean up stale platform resources. The customer is responsible for deleting the underlying cloud infrastructure. |
| Feature requests | Customer | Customer submits feature requests via the support channel. Akka triages, prioritizes, and communicates status. |

<!-- </details> -->

## <a href="about:blank#_6_encryption_keys_and_certificates"></a> 6. Encryption, keys, and certificates

In BYOK8s, encryption of customer data is the customer’s responsibility: database (at rest and in transit) and ingress TLS in transit (either by providing a certificate issuer or by granting Akka enough access to solve DNS-01 / HTTP-01 challenges). Akka manages encryption internal to the platform: mTLS between Akka components and TLS to the Federation Plane (see the Architecture appendix), and encryption of secrets synced from the Federation Plane (see the Data protection appendix). Lifecycle of cryptographic materials follows Akka’s Key Management and Cryptography Policy.

At a glance
- **Customer**: Owns customer-data encryption end-to-end: database (at rest and in transit), ingress TLS via certificate issuer or DNS/HTTP-01 access. Manages CMEK key material.
- **Akka**: Manages encryption internal to the platform: mTLS between Akka components, TLS to the Federation Plane, and encryption of FP-synced secrets.

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary> -->
**Responsibilities**
<!-- </summary> -->

| Activity | Owner | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer-data encryption | Customer | The customer is responsible for setting up encryption of customer data: database (at rest and in transit) and ingress TLS (certificate issuer, or DNS-01 / HTTP-01 access for Akka). |
| Platform-internal encryption | Akka | Akka manages encryption internal to the platform: mTLS between Akka components (per the Architecture appendix), TLS to the Federation Plane, and encryption of FP-synced secrets (per the Data protection appendix). |
| Cryptographic key management | Customer | Lifecycle, rotation, and access control of cryptographic materials follow the Akka Key Management and Cryptography Policy. Cloud-native KMS handles lifecycle for Akka-managed materials. Customer-managed keys (CMEK, BYO certificates) are managed by the customer per the same policy. |
| Customer-managed database encryption keys (CMEK) | Customer | Where CMEK is selected, customer creates and maintains key material in their KMS and shares the identifier with Akka. Customer is responsible for ensuring continued access to the CMEK. |
| Customer-provided TLS certificates | Customer | Where Akka cannot automatically provision TLS (e.g., private load balancers, customer-owned domains), the customer provides certificates or configures cert-manager. Akka validates and deploys. |

<!-- </details> -->

## <a href="about:blank#_7_observability_and_monitoring"></a> 7. Observability and monitoring

Monitoring follows the same platform/application boundary as the rest of this model: Akka watches the platform layer it operates, and the customer watches their own applications plus the cluster and access tooling on their side. Application telemetry flows to whichever observability vendor the customer chooses.

At a glance
- **Akka**: Watches the health of the platform it operates, for example its system and infrastructure pods, database health and resource use, platform runtime errors, and internal processing-lag signals, and acts on them as part of running the region. Also tracks platform availability and region telemetry, with uptime reports on request.
- **Customer**: Watches their own Akka applications, for example pod resource use, projection health, and any service-specific metrics, along with the cluster, node, and database infrastructure they operate. Sets the thresholds that make sense for their services, configures Teleport alerting on their side, exports application telemetry over OTLP, and owns cloud-native audit logging on the cloud account.

|  | This lays out the division of responsibility between the platform and application layers. It is not a fixed catalog of alerts, a set of committed thresholds, or a service-level guarantee, the signals and tooling Akka uses to run the platform change over time, and availability and support commitments live in the Akka Federation Plane SLA Policy and the Customer Support Policy. Monitoring of the customer’s own application pods sits with the customer rather than Akka, since they are best placed to define what healthy looks like for their services, and Akka can share recommended metrics and thresholds on request. |

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary> -->
**Responsibilities**
<!-- </summary> -->

| Activity | Owner | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform health monitoring | Akka | Akka monitors and responds to the health of the platform it operates, for example its system and infrastructure pods, database health and resource use, platform runtime errors, and internal processing-lag signals. Described generically; the specific signals and tooling change as the platform evolves. |
| Platform availability monitoring | Akka | Akka monitors and reports availability of the Akka Platform. Uptime reports available on request. Platform availability commitments are governed by the Akka Federation Plane SLA Policy. Availability of customer-deployed services running on the platform is the customer’s responsibility, see the customer applications section. |

| Akka region platform telemetry | Akka | Akka monitors region-level metrics and logs and notifies the customer as needed. |
| Application monitoring | Customer | The customer monitors their own application pods, for example resource use, projection health, and service-specific metrics, and sets the thresholds that matter for their services. Recommended metrics and thresholds are available from Akka on request. |
| Teleport access monitoring | Customer | Teleport sits at the boundary between the customer’s infrastructure and Akka’s, so meaningful coverage needs both sides; the customer configures alerting for Teleport access on their side. |
| Customer-side platform telemetry (optional) | Customer | Customer may optionally configure their own telemetry over the cluster and database since they own the cloud account. Akka can advise on which components are appropriate to observe externally. |
| Cloud-native audit logging | Customer | Customer enables cloud-native audit/security services (e.g., CloudTrail, Cloud Audit Logs, equivalents) and notifies Akka if any suspicious SIEM alerts are observed. |
| Application telemetry export | Customer | Customer configures export of application logs, metrics, and traces to their observability platform via Akka’s OpenTelemetry (OTLP) exporters, which support any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend. |

<!-- </details> -->

## <a href="about:blank#_8_backups_disaster_recovery_and_multi_region"></a> 8. Backups, disaster recovery, and multi-region

The customer runs the database with point-in-time recovery (PITR) on their infrastructure; Akka uses Velero for Kubernetes resource backups with infrastructure the customer provides. Restore testing, disaster-recovery exercises, and replication topology are joint decisions, and Akka provides multi-region failover tooling.

At a glance
- **Akka**: Operates Velero for K8s resource backups (against customer-provided IAM and object storage), provides multi-region failover tooling and runbooks. RTO/RPO targets are set by the agreement.
- **Customer**: Configures database point-in-time recovery (PITR), notifies Akka after ad-hoc backups, specifies replication mode per service, is consulted before failover.

## <a href="about:blank#_12_customer_applications_akka_sdk_services"></a> 12. Customer applications (Akka SDK services)

Applications that the customer builds with the Akka SDK are owned end-to-end by the customer: source, deployment, configuration, secrets, runtime monitoring, and access control.

At a glance **Customer (end-to-end)**: Source, build, deploy, version, roll back. Service config and secrets. Application IAM (JWT/JWKS), Service ACLs, security logs. SDLC tooling (IDE, repos, CI/CD). All application observability.

**Responsibilities**
<!-- </summary> -->

| Activity | Owner | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application code and dependency patching | Customer | Customer reviews their application code and any libraries or dependencies they introduce for security issues and vulnerabilities. The JVM, container base image, OS, and Akka runtime packaged into the deployed service are patched by Akka (see Platform maintenance and releases, Infrastructure patching). |
| Service configuration (incl. secrets) | Customer | Customer configures services to enable their functionality, including secrets used to access other services. |
| Integrations setup (broker, object storage, etc.) | Customer | Where services depend on integrations such as message brokers or object storage, the customer configures these for the Akka Project before service deployment. |
| Application deployments | Customer | Customer owns and manages the lifecycle of Akka SDK applications: build, version, deploy, roll back. |
| Source code management | Customer | Source code management for Akka service implementations is the customer’s responsibility. |
| Service scaling limits | Customer | Customer controls service instance counts within configured platform limits. |
| Application logs | Customer | Metrics and logs from services built with the Akka SDK are sent to the customer’s logging platform and are not ingested into Akka’s observability stack. |
| SDK logs | Customer | Customer monitors SDK and application logs in their own observability platform. |
| Application security logs | Customer | Customer can configure dashboards over cloud security logs and stream them to a GSOC (Global Security Operations Center) or observability tool. |
| Service ACLs | Customer | Customer configures Service ACLs to protect access to non-public service endpoints. |
| Application IAM (JWT/JWKS) | Customer | Akka SDK supports access scoping through JWTs and JWKS. The customer configures issuer trust, claims, and ACLs appropriate for their application. |
| SDLC tooling (IDE, repos, CI/CD) | Customer | Customer owns and operates the SDLC environment used to build services running on Akka. Akka ships developer tooling that the customer integrates into their SDLC. |

Akka Automated Operations consists of two planes:

- **Federation Plane**, a globally-accessible coordination service managed by Akka. Handles organizations, accounts, role assignments, key rotation, access tokens, and application deployment across regions. Designed to be highly resilient. In the rare event that the Federation Plane is unavailable, applications running in the Application Plane continue to operate.
- **Application Plane**, one or more federated regions. In BYOK8s, each region runs inside a Kubernetes cluster that the customer provides and operates inside their cloud account. The cluster hosts the Akka operators for routing, elasticity, deployment, certificate management, key rotation, and cross-region failover, together with the persistence store. The customer is responsible for the cluster, its upgrades, the database, and their own container registry; Akka manages the Akka components running on top.
Communication between Federation Plane and Application Plane uses TLS with token-based authentication. Inter-region communication between applications uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with per-component certificates.

All application data stays within the customer’s cloud region and VPC and is isolated from the Federation Plane. Data at rest is encrypted using the cloud provider’s encryption mechanism. Customers can rely on Akka-managed encryption or use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).

Akka applies an additional encryption layer for sensitive material that is synced from the Federation Plane to regional execution clusters: project secrets, authentication tokens, OpenID refresh tokens, and customer-supplied secrets. Lifecycle, rotation, and access control of cryptographic materials follow the Akka Key Management and Cryptography Policy.

### Recovery objectives (RTO/RPO)

RTO and RPO targets are defined in the customer’s agreement.

Compliance posture (SOC 2 Type II, annual third-party penetration test, current subprocessor list) is published on trust.akka.io.

<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary> -->
**Details**
<!-- </summary> -->
Some enterprises require that Kubernetes API servers in their cloud accounts have no public endpoint. Akka supports this through Teleport, an identity-aware proxy and certificate authority that creates an authenticated, encrypted bridge between the Federation Plane and private Kubernetes clusters.

- No public Kubernetes API endpoints, API servers remain entirely private.
- Reverse tunnels, Teleport agents in each region initiate outbound connections to the Teleport proxy; the Federation Plane never connects directly into the region.
- Complete audit trail, all authentication and API calls are logged. Audit logs are available to the customer on request.
- Cloud-portable, works across AWS, GCP, Azure, and on-premises.
