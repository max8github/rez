# RACI

This page lists every activity in the BYOK8s (Bring Your Own Kubernetes) shared responsibility model, where Akka runs inside a Kubernetes cluster that the Customer provides and operates. In BYOK8s the Customer owns more of the stack than in a fully Akka-managed model; for example, database backups and Kubernetes and database upgrades are Customer-owned here.

The four RACI roles:

- **R (Responsible):** the party that does the work.
- **A (Accountable):** the party ultimately answerable for the outcome.
- **C (Consulted):** the party whose input is sought before or during the work.
- **I (Informed):** the party kept up to date on progress or results.
Each role cell uses one of the following values: `C` = Customer, `A` = Akka, `±` = Akka and Customer, blank = not applicable.

Filter by layer or owner, or search across activity, description, and cadence. Owner is derived from the Responsible column: Customer, Akka, or shared.

| Sub-category | Activity | R | A | C | I | Description | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Shared Responsibility | C | C |  |  | Anything not explicitly listed in this RACI is the Customer’s responsibility. This includes the underlying cloud account, customer application code, customer-side operational tooling, and any concern not explicitly assigned to Akka in the rows below.

## <a href="about:blank#_infrastructure"></a> Infrastructure

| Sub-category | Activity | R | A | C | I | Description | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Permissions | Infrastructure Access Control and IAM | C | C | A | C | Customer is responsible for maintaining strict access control to the cloud infrastructure |  |
| Cloud Account | Billing & Ownership | C | C |  |  | Customer owns and operates the account and pays the bill |  |
| Cloud Account | Provisioning | C | C | ± | ± | Customer sets up a dedicated cloud account for Akka to use for hosting the Platform. A dedicated account is recommended to simplify cost tracking and security boundaries; Akka advises against provisioning additional resources in it to prevent management conflicts, and anything the Customer adds outside this scope becomes the Customer’s responsibility. |  |
| Cloud Account | Quotas & Service Limits | C | C | A | A | Customer ensures enough quota based on usage for compute, storage, etc in the cloud account |  |
| Networking | Private Connectivity | C | C |  | A | The Customer designs, implements, and operates private connectivity into and out of the cluster using whatever pattern fits their environment |  |
| Networking | Ingress/Egress Connectivity Using Public Patterns | A | A |  | C | AAO installs a load balancer for the region and configures a certificate issuer (Let’s Encrypt by default). This certificate provider is used for platform APIs and generated application hostnames. |  |
| Networking | Ingress/Egress Connectivity Using Private Patterns with Auto-Generated IP Address | A | A | A | C | Akka provisions the load balancer for the region with an automatically generated IP address, ensuring internal communication without traversing the public internet. |  |
| Networking | IP Address Management / CIDR Range Allocation | C | C | A | A | Customer assigns an appropriately sized CIDR block for cases where peering or hub and spoke is desired. |  |
| Networking | VPC Peering or Hub and Spoke Enablement (Not available on all cloud providers) | C | C | A | A | Customer sets up VPC peering or hub and spoke enablement. |  |
| Networking | IP Allowlist | C | C | A | A | The Customer is responsible for setting up and maintaining the IP allowlist for NAT gateways and load balancer. The Customer informs Akka of changes that may affect Akka runtime & operators connectivity. |  |

| Maintenance | K8s / DB Upgrades | C | C | A | A | The Kubernetes cluster and database are the Customer’s infrastructure in BYOK8s. The Customer schedules and runs Kubernetes and database upgrades. The Customer must consult Akka in advance so that Akka can certify the target versions against the Akka runtime & operators. Running an unverified version may break Platform functionality and is the Customer’s responsibility. |  |
| Maintenance | Infrastructure Change Coordination | C | C | A | A | The Customer informs and coordinates with Akka before any change to the cluster, database, networking, or other infrastructure the Akka runtime & operators run on. Unannounced infrastructure changes can break the Akka Region and are the Customer’s responsibility. |  |

Akka auto-provisions and maintains the cloud infrastructure and overhead required to run an Akka region. Automatic provisioning and de-provisioning of compute instances to accommodate utilization demand. Storage for the underlying persistence store scales automatically; its compute does not. Akka has various sizing options to keep costs in check but HA is the default. |  |
| Operations | Scalability (Infrastructure) | C | C |  | A | Customer is responsible for ensuring scalability for the Akka runtime & operators; includes compute capacity availability for node pools and database scalability |  |
| Cloud/Infrastructure Audit Logging | Infrastructure Security Audit Logs | C | C |  | A | If any suspicious SIEM alerts are found, please notify Akka. |  |
| PKI | Customer Managed Database Encryption Keys | C | C | A | A | The Customer creates and maintains the key material for the CMEK and shares its identifier with Akka. Customer is responsible for ensuring access to the CMEK |  |
| PKI | Customer-Provided TLS Certificates | C | C |  | C | Where Akka cannot automatically provision TLS certificates (e.g., private load balancers, or where the Customer brings its own domain), the Customer provides certificates or configures cert-manager. Akka validates and deploys. See [https://doc.akka.io/operations/tls-certificates.html#_custom_server_certificates](https://doc.akka.io/operations/tls-certificates.html#_custom_server_certificates) for details. |  |
| Backups and Recovery | Database Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) | C | C |  | A | Customer is responsible for configuring continuous point-in-time recovery (PITR) for the database | At least 8 days retention |
| Backups and Recovery | Database Backups (Ad-Hoc) | C | C |  | A | The Customer notifies Akka after taking ad-hoc database backups (e.g., before high-risk changes, or snapshots taken for incident handling). |  |
| Backups and Recovery | Velero Used for K8s Resources | ± | ± |  |  | Akka uses Velero to back up stateful Kubernetes resources so they can be restored. Customer sets up necessary IAM binding and object storage for Akka |  |
| Backups and Recovery | Backup Restore Testing | ± | ± | C |  | Akka performs periodic restore testing against backups; results are summarized on request. The Disaster Recovery Exercise row covers joint exercises. |  |
| Permissions | Service Accounts & Keys | C | C | A | A | Customer creates and manages the service accounts, service account keys, and IAM bindings required for Platform operation within the cloud account. |  |
