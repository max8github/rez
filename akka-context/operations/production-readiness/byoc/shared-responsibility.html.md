# Shared responsibility model

This page describes how responsibilities are divided between Akka and the customer when running Akka Automated Operations (AAO) inside the customer’s cloud account under the BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) deployment model.

The at-a-glance summary and the per-area sections below assign an owner to each activity. For the authoritative row-by-row breakdown, with the full Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / Informed split, see the [RACI](raci.html).

|  | The policies published on [trust.akka.io](https://trust.akka.io/) and the Customer Support Policy take precedence over any summary here. |

## <a href="about:blank#_executive_summary"></a> Executive summary

Akka Automated Operations is a managed platform that runs inside your cloud account. Akka takes responsibility for the platform itself: the runtime, operators, encryption, region installation, scaling, patching, observability of the platform, backups, and the operational rituals that surround them. You take responsibility for the cloud account, the network you bring, the human identities that access the Akka console, the applications you build with the Akka SDK, and the data those applications process.

Because AAO operates inside your cloud account, the model is genuinely shared. Akka manages the platform layer end-to-end; you manage the layers above and below it; a small number of activities are jointly owned with the lead and consulted parties named explicitly.

Shared responsibility extends to going live. Akka has a set of standards it expects of customer applications before flipping prod traffic on: sizing, observability, CI/CD, functional and non-functional testing, DR (disaster recovery) and rollback rehearsal. The [production readiness checklist](checklist.html) captures those standards and the sign-off gate Akka recommends before launch.

|  | **Catch-all** Anything not explicitly listed in this document is the customer’s responsibility. This includes customer application code, customer-side operational tooling, and any concern not explicitly assigned to Akka. The customer may request additional operational support from Akka through the standard support channel. |

## <a href="about:blank#_layered_view_of_aao"></a> Layered view of AAO

The customer owns the applications and the underlying cloud account; Akka manages the platform layer in between.

| Layer | Owner | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer Applications (Akka SDK services) | Customer | Source, build, deploy; service config and secrets; app ACLs / IAM (JWTs); app observability / SDK logs |
| Akka Platform (managed by Akka) | Akka | Akka runtime and operators; region Kubernetes cluster; persistence store; container registry; encryption (at rest, in transit, mTLS); backups and restore testing; scaling, patching, releases; Federation Plane integration; platform observability |
| Cloud Account (AWS account / GCP project / Azure subscription) | Customer | Billing and quotas; IAM that grants Akka access; CIDR allocation, peering; DNS records, IP allowlists; cloud-native audit logs; customer-managed KMS keys |

## <a href="about:blank#_how_to_read_this"></a> How to read this

Each activity in the matrix has an owner, the party that is Responsible and Accountable. The other party may be Consulted or Informed; called out in the description where relevant.

| Owner | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Customer | The customer is Responsible and Accountable for the activity. Akka may be Consulted or Informed. |
| Akka | Akka is Responsible and Accountable for the activity. The customer may be Consulted or Informed. |
| Shared | Akka and the customer share responsibility. The split is described in the row’s description. |
Because Akka operates inside infrastructure you control, coordinate with Akka before infrastructure changes that could affect the Region.

Reaching the reliability and availability your deployment is built for depends on both sides meeting the responsibilities below, worked through with your Akka team; your agreement and the Federation Plane SLA Policy remain the authoritative statement of what is committed. See the [production readiness overview](../index.html) and the [BYOC production readiness checklist](checklist.html).

| Cryptographic key management | Customer | Lifecycle, rotation, and access control of cryptographic materials follow the Akka Key Management and Cryptography Policy. Cloud-native KMS handles lifecycle for Akka-managed materials. Customer-managed keys (CMEK, BYO certificates) are managed by the customer per the same policy. |
| Customer-managed database encryption keys (CMEK) | Customer | Where CMEK is selected, customer creates and maintains key material in their KMS and shares the identifier with Akka. Customer is responsible for ensuring continued access to the CMEK. |
| Customer-provided TLS certificates | Customer | Where Akka cannot automatically provision TLS (e.g., private load balancers, customer-owned domains), the customer provides certificates or configures cert-manager. Akka validates and deploys. |

<!-- </details> -->

## <a href="about:blank#_7_observability_and_monitoring"></a> 7. Observability and monitoring

Monitoring follows the same platform/application boundary as the rest of this model: Akka watches the platform layer it operates, and the customer watches their own applications and the access tooling on their side. Application telemetry flows to whichever observability vendor the customer chooses.

At a glance
- **Akka**: Watches the health of the platform it operates, for example its system and infrastructure pods, database health and resource use, platform runtime errors, and internal processing-lag signals, and acts on them as part of running the region. Also tracks platform availability and region telemetry, with uptime reports on request.
- **Customer**: Watches their own Akka applications, for example pod resource use, projection health, and any service-specific metrics, and sets the thresholds that make sense for their services. Configures Teleport alerting on their side, exports application telemetry over OTLP, and owns cloud-native audit logging on the cloud account.

|  | This lays out the division of responsibility between the platform and application layers. It is not a fixed catalog of alerts, a set of committed thresholds, or a service-level guarantee, the signals and tooling Akka uses to run the platform change over time, and availability and support commitments live in the Akka Federation Plane SLA Policy and the Customer Support Policy. Monitoring of the customer’s own application pods sits with the customer rather than Akka, since they are best placed to define what healthy looks like for their services, and Akka can share recommended metrics and thresholds on request. |

| Application monitoring | Customer | The customer monitors their own application pods, for example resource use, projection health, and service-specific metrics, and sets the thresholds that matter for their services. Recommended metrics and thresholds are available from Akka on request. |
| Teleport access monitoring | Customer | Teleport sits at the boundary between the customer’s infrastructure and Akka’s, so meaningful coverage needs both sides; the customer configures alerting for Teleport access on their side. |
| Customer-side platform telemetry (optional) | Customer | Customer may optionally configure their own telemetry over the cluster and database since they own the cloud account. Akka can advise on which components are appropriate to observe externally. |
| Cloud-native audit logging | Customer | Customer enables cloud-native audit/security services (e.g., CloudTrail, Cloud Audit Logs, equivalents) and notifies Akka if any suspicious SIEM alerts are observed. |
| Application telemetry export | Customer | Customer configures export of application logs, metrics, and traces to their observability platform via Akka’s OpenTelemetry (OTLP) exporters, which support any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend. |

AAO consists of two planes:

- **Federation Plane**, a globally-accessible coordination service managed by Akka. Handles organizations, accounts, role assignments, key rotation, access tokens, and application deployment across regions. Designed to be highly resilient. In the rare event that the Federation Plane is unavailable, applications running in the Application Plane continue to operate.
- **Application Plane**, one or more federated regions, each running independently inside the customer’s cloud account. Each region contains a Kubernetes cluster, a persistence store, a container registry, and Akka operators for routing, elasticity, deployment, certificate management, key rotation, and cross-region failover.
Communication between Federation Plane and Application Plane uses TLS with token-based authentication. Inter-region communication between applications uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with per-component certificates.

All application data stays within the customer’s cloud region and VPC and is isolated from the Federation Plane. Data at rest is encrypted using the cloud provider’s encryption mechanism. Customers can rely on Akka-managed encryption or use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).

Akka applies an additional encryption layer for sensitive material that is synced from the Federation Plane to regional execution clusters: project secrets, authentication tokens, OpenID refresh tokens, and customer-supplied secrets. Lifecycle, rotation, and access control of cryptographic materials follow the Akka Key Management and Cryptography Policy.

### Recovery objectives (RTO/RPO)

RTO and RPO targets are defined in the customer’s agreement.

Compliance posture (SOC 2 Type II, annual third-party penetration test, current subprocessor list) is published on [trust.akka.io](https://trust.akka.io/).

Some enterprises require that Kubernetes API servers in their cloud accounts have no public endpoint. Akka supports this through Teleport, an identity-aware proxy and certificate authority that creates an authenticated, encrypted bridge between the Federation Plane and private Kubernetes clusters.

- No public Kubernetes API endpoints, API servers remain entirely private.
- Reverse tunnels, Teleport agents in each region initiate outbound connections to the Teleport proxy; the Federation Plane never connects directly into the region.
- Complete audit trail, all authentication and API calls are logged. Audit logs are available to the customer on request.
- Cloud-portable, works across AWS, GCP, Azure, and on-premises.
