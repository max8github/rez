# Shared responsibility model

This page describes how responsibilities are divided between Akka and the customer when running Akka Automated Operations (AAO) under the Dedicated deployment model, where Akka owns and operates the cloud account and runs the platform within it.

The at-a-glance summary and the per-area sections below assign an owner to each activity. For the authoritative row-by-row breakdown, with the full Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / Informed split, see the [RACI](raci.html).

|  | The policies published on [trust.akka.io](https://trust.akka.io/) and the Customer Support Policy take precedence over any summary here. |

## <a href="about:blank#_executive_summary"></a> Executive summary

Akka Automated Operations is a managed platform. Under the Dedicated model, Akka owns and operates the cloud account that hosts it and runs everything within: the runtime, operators, encryption, region installation, scaling, patching, platform observability, backups, the in-region network, and the security monitoring over the account. That leaves you the least to run of the three deployment models (BYOK8s, BYOC, and Dedicated): you own the applications you build with the Akka SDK, the data they process, any customer-managed encryption keys or TLS certificates you bring, and your side of the operational partnership. A small number of activities are jointly owned, with the lead and consulted parties named explicitly.

Shared responsibility extends to going live. Akka has a set of standards it expects of customer applications before flipping prod traffic on: sizing, observability, CI/CD, functional and non-functional testing, DR (disaster recovery) and rollback rehearsal. The [production readiness checklist](checklist.html) captures those standards and the sign-off gate Akka recommends before launch.

|  | **Catch-all** Anything not explicitly listed in this document is the customer’s responsibility. This includes customer application code, customer-side operational tooling, and any concern not explicitly assigned to Akka. The customer may request additional operational support from Akka through the standard support channel. |

## <a href="about:blank#_layered_view_of_aao"></a> Layered view of AAO

The customer owns the applications; Akka owns and operates the cloud account and the platform layer beneath them.

| Layer | Owner | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer Applications (Akka SDK services) | Customer | Source, build, deploy; service config and secrets; app ACLs / IAM (JWTs); app observability / SDK logs; customer-managed database encryption keys (CMEK) and BYO TLS certificates where brought |
| Akka Platform (managed by Akka) | Akka | Akka runtime and operators; region Kubernetes cluster; persistence store; container registry; encryption (at rest, in transit, mTLS); backups and restore testing; scaling, patching, releases; Federation Plane integration; platform observability |
| Cloud Account | Akka | Billing and quotas; account IAM; CIDR allocation, peering; DNS records, IP allowlists; cloud-native audit logs, SIEM, and cloud security posture |

## <a href="about:blank#_how_to_read_this"></a> How to read this

Each activity in the matrix has an owner, the party that is Responsible and Accountable. The other party may be Consulted or Informed; called out in the description where relevant.

| Owner | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Customer | The customer is Responsible and Accountable for the activity. Akka may be Consulted or Informed. |
| Akka | Akka is Responsible and Accountable for the activity. The customer may be Consulted or Informed. |
| Shared | Akka and the customer share responsibility. The split is described in the row’s description. |
Because Akka owns and operates the cloud infrastructure, there is little customer-side infrastructure to coordinate on, though some aspects, such as sizing and capacity, are still worked through jointly with your Akka team, as is any network you choose to integrate with the Akka region (for example, a transit gateway).

Reaching the reliability and availability your deployment is built for depends on both sides meeting the responsibilities below, worked through with your Akka team; your agreement and the Federation Plane SLA Policy remain the authoritative statement of what is committed. See the [production readiness overview](../index.html) and the [Dedicated production readiness checklist](checklist.html).

## <a href="about:blank#_2_networking_and_connectivity"></a> 2. Networking and connectivity

Akka creates the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and all in-region networking using cloud-provider best practices, within the account it owns. Because Akka owns the account, the surrounding network is Akka’s to operate as well: CIDR allocation, peering, IP allowlists, and DNS. The customer is involved only where it integrates its own network with the Akka region, for example a transit gateway.

At a glance
- **Akka**: Builds and operates the in-region VPC, load balancers, and certificate issuer, along with CIDR allocation, peering, IP allowlists, and DNS.
- **Customer**: Coordinates with Akka only where it integrates its own corporate network with the Akka region (for example, a transit gateway), and provides the address ranges Akka uses for allowlists.

| Customer-managed database encryption keys (CMEK) | Customer | Where CMEK is selected, customer creates and maintains key material in their KMS and shares the identifier with Akka. Customer is responsible for ensuring continued access to the CMEK. |
| Customer-provided TLS certificates | Customer | Where Akka cannot automatically provision TLS (e.g., customer-owned domains), the customer provides certificates or configures cert-manager. Akka validates and deploys. |

<!-- </details> -->

## <a href="about:blank#_7_observability_and_monitoring"></a> 7. Observability and monitoring

Monitoring follows the same platform/application boundary as the rest of this model: Akka watches the platform layer it operates and, because Akka owns the cloud account in Dedicated, the account’s security monitoring as well; the customer watches their own applications. Application telemetry flows to whichever observability vendor the customer chooses.

At a glance
- **Akka**: Watches the health of the platform it operates, for example its system and infrastructure pods, database health and resource use, platform runtime errors, and internal processing-lag signals, and acts on them as part of running the region. Also tracks platform availability and region telemetry, with uptime reports on request. Owns cloud-native audit logging, SIEM / security monitoring, and cloud security posture for the dedicated account.
- **Customer**: Watches their own Akka applications, for example pod resource use, projection health, and any service-specific metrics, and sets the thresholds that make sense for their services. Exports application telemetry over OTLP.

|  | This lays out the division of responsibility between the platform and application layers. It is not a fixed catalog of alerts, a set of committed thresholds, or a service-level guarantee, the signals and tooling Akka uses to run the platform change over time, and availability and support commitments live in the Akka Federation Plane SLA Policy and the Customer Support Policy. Monitoring of the customer’s own application pods sits with the customer rather than Akka, since they are best placed to define what healthy looks like for their services, and Akka can share recommended metrics and thresholds on request. |

AAO consists of two planes:

- **Federation Plane**, a globally-accessible coordination service managed by Akka. Handles organizations, accounts, role assignments, key rotation, access tokens, and application deployment across regions. Designed to be highly resilient. In the rare event that the Federation Plane is unavailable, applications running in the Application Plane continue to operate.
- **Application Plane**, one or more federated regions, each running independently inside the dedicated cloud account that Akka owns and operates. Each region contains a Kubernetes cluster, a persistence store, a container registry, and Akka operators for routing, elasticity, deployment, certificate management, key rotation, and cross-region failover.
Communication between Federation Plane and Application Plane uses TLS with token-based authentication. Inter-region communication between applications uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with per-component certificates.

All application data stays within the dedicated cloud region and VPC and is isolated from the Federation Plane. Data at rest is encrypted using the cloud provider’s encryption mechanism. Customers can rely on Akka-managed encryption or use Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).

Akka applies an additional encryption layer for sensitive material that is synced from the Federation Plane to regional execution clusters: project secrets, authentication tokens, OpenID refresh tokens, and customer-supplied secrets. Lifecycle, rotation, and access control of cryptographic materials follow the Akka Key Management and Cryptography Policy.

### Recovery objectives (RTO/RPO)

RTO and RPO targets are defined in the customer’s agreement.

Compliance posture (SOC 2 Type II, annual third-party penetration test, current subprocessor list) is published on [trust.akka.io](https://trust.akka.io/).

<!-- </summary> -->
Some enterprises require that Kubernetes API servers have no public endpoint. Akka supports this through Teleport, an identity-aware proxy and certificate authority that creates an authenticated, encrypted bridge between the Federation Plane and private Kubernetes clusters.

- No public Kubernetes API endpoints, API servers remain entirely private.
- Reverse tunnels, Teleport agents in each region initiate outbound connections to the Teleport proxy; the Federation Plane never connects directly into the region.
- Complete audit trail, all authentication and API calls are logged. Audit logs are available to the customer on request.
- Cloud-portable, works across AWS, GCP, Azure, and on-premises.
