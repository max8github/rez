# RACI

This page lists every activity in the Dedicated deployment model, where Akka owns and operates the cloud account and runs the platform within it. Dedicated is BYOC with the cloud-account layer re-owned by Akka, so most activities match BYOC, with the account, networking, and account-security rows owned by Akka.

The four RACI roles:

- **R (Responsible):** the party that does the work.
- **A (Accountable):** the party ultimately answerable for the outcome.
- **C (Consulted):** the party whose input is sought before or during the work.
- **I (Informed):** the party kept up to date on progress or results.
Each role cell uses one of the following values: `C` = Customer, `A` = Akka, `±` = Akka and Customer, blank = not applicable.

Filter by layer or owner, or search across activity, description, and cadence. Owner is derived from the Responsible column: Customer, Akka, or shared.
