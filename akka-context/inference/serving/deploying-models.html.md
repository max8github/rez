# Deploying models

Feature set: Inference Contact [our support](https://akka.io/contact) for access.
*This functionality evolves quickly, the behavior and APIs might change between releases without further notice.* A model deployment is one serving engine running one model on an accelerator. You declare the deployment in a model descriptor and apply the file, which downloads the weights and starts the engine.

## <a href="about:blank#_declaring_a_deployment"></a> Declaring a deployment

A deployment names the checkpoint to serve, the accelerator to run it on, and the name clients use to ask for it:

```yaml
resource: ModelDeployment
resourceVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: docs
spec:
  model: mistralai/Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512
  servedModelName: docs
  replicas: 1
  placement:
    accelerator: l4-dedicated
  engine:
    maxModelLen: 8192
    memoryPercent: 90
```
`placement.accelerator` is required. There is no path that lets the scheduler choose the hardware, because the card a model lands on decides how the model performs, and a deployment placed on whatever happens to be free changes latency without anyone asking for it.

`servedModelName` defaults to `metadata.name`. It is the name clients send in the `model` field of a request, described in [Calling a deployed model](calling-a-model.html).

See [ModelDeployment](../../reference/descriptors/model-descriptor.html#modeldeployment) for every field.

### <a href="about:blank#_tuning_the_engine"></a> Tuning the engine

The `engine` block decides how the model is served:

| Field | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `maxModelLen` | Context length the model is served at, prompt and output combined. Larger values consume more GPU memory and lower the concurrency the card sustains. |
| `memoryPercent` | Share of the card’s memory the engine may use, from 1 to 100. Required on a shared accelerator. |
| `quantization` | Numeric format for the weights: `none`, `fp8`, `awq`, `gptq`, or `bitsandbytes`. |
| `textOnly` | Drops the vision tower from a multimodal checkpoint and returns its memory to the KV cache. The engine then rejects images entirely, so set it only for a multimodal checkpoint you use for text. |
| `checkpointFormat` | Weight format of the checkpoint being loaded, `auto` or `mistral`. |
| `toolCalling` | Enables OpenAI-style tool calling. |
Always set `maxModelLen`. Some checkpoints declare a default of 262144, and the engine sizes a KV cache for whatever the checkpoint declares.

`checkpointFormat` is never inferred from the model name. A checkpoint published in Mistral’s native format needs `checkpointFormat: mistral`. Without it, the checkpoint is read along the standard path and its files are parsed incorrectly.

### <a href="about:blank#_enabling_tool_calling"></a> Enabling tool calling

```yaml
engine:
  maxModelLen: 8192
  memoryPercent: 90
  checkpointFormat: mistral
  toolCalling:
    enabled: true
    parser: mistral
```
Both sub-keys are required. `enabled` without `parser`, or `parser` without `enabled`, fails validation. Omit the block and the model serves normally but ignores the `tools` field in requests.

The parser has to match the model family. Valid names come from the serving engine the platform pins rather than from the CLI, so the value is only checked for shape. Common values are `pythonic`, `mistral`, and `hermes`. Choose it deliberately: nothing verifies that a parser matches the model, and the wrong one starts healthy and returns tool calls as ordinary prose.

### <a href="about:blank#_supplying_a_token_for_gated_weights"></a> Supplying a token for gated weights

Checkpoints behind an account need a token, declared as a secret and referenced by the deployment:

```yaml
resource: Secret
resourceVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hf-token
spec:
  type: generic
  data:
    token: hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
---
resource: ModelDeployment
resourceVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: docs
spec:
  model: mistralai/Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512
  placement:
    accelerator: l4-dedicated
  source:
    huggingFaceTokenSecret: hf-token/token
    cache:
      enabled: true
      size: 100Gi
```

|  | The token goes into the file literally. A descriptor does not interpolate environment variables, so a value written as `${HF_TOKEN}` is passed through as that exact string and the download fails with an authentication error.

Your working copy of the descriptor therefore holds a live credential. Do not commit it. To keep the descriptor in version control, commit a copy with the token replaced by a placeholder. |
Enabling the cache persists the weights and the compiled artifacts across restarts. Without it, every restart pays the download and compilation cost again.

## <a href="about:blank#_validating_before_you_apply"></a> Validating before you apply

Validation is offline and reports every problem in the file at once. Nothing is deployed:

```shell
akka models validate -f models.yaml
```
Some rules can only be checked against the cluster, such as whether a served name collides with a deployment that is already running. To run those without persisting anything:

```shell
akka models apply -f models.yaml --dry-run
```

## <a href="about:blank#_applying_the_descriptor"></a> Applying the descriptor

```shell
akka models apply -f models.yaml
```
Applying again is safe. It updates what changed and leaves the rest alone. Apply also provisions the TLS certificate for any hostname the file names, which takes a minute or two the first time.

## <a href="about:blank#_waiting_for_a_model_to_become_ready"></a> Waiting for a model to become ready

```shell
akka models get docs --wait
```
The first deployment downloads the weights, so expect several minutes. If a model stays unready, the same command without `--wait` prints the reason in plain text.

Once every model is running:

```shell
akka models list
```

```shell
NAME   MODEL                                    SERVES   KV TOKENS   MAX CONC   DEVICE      READY
docs   mistralai/Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512   docs     143472      17.51      NVIDIA L4   True
```

|  | `MAX CONC` is a sizing estimate, not a limit. It is the number of concurrent requests the KV cache comfortably holds at the configured context length, which makes it useful for capacity planning. Nothing enforces it. The model accepts more concurrent requests than this number and answers them, trading latency for throughput as the queue grows. |

## <a href="about:blank#_serving_several_names_from_one_deployment"></a> Serving several names from one deployment

A LoRA adapter is served from the base model and addressed as its own model name, so one deployment can answer to several names:

```yaml
spec:
  adapters:
    - name: docs-support
      path: s3://acme-adapters/support/
```
Each adapter name has to be unique and must not collide with `servedModelName`. Adapter names appear alongside the base name wherever served names are listed, including on the route described in [Exposing models on a hostname](exposing-models.html).

## <a href="about:blank#_next_steps"></a> Next steps

A deployed model is not yet reachable from outside the cluster. See [Exposing models on a hostname](exposing-models.html).
