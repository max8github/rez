# Akka Internals

Akka is an agentic AI platform for enterprises: a full-stack system for building, running, and governing production-grade agentic AI. It brings developer experience, runtime, and governance together in one integrated system.

![The Akka agentic platform — build](_images/capabilities/akka-platform-intro.png)
The platform is organized into four layers:

- **Components** — the building blocks you compose into a system: agents, workflows, entities, endpoints, views, and consumers.
- **Runtime** — the engine that handles the hard distributed-systems problems: clustering, resilience, zero-trust networking, data sharding, and traffic steering.
- **Cloud Stack** — the infrastructure behind [Automated Operations](akka-automated-operations.html): active-active HA/DR, runtime patching, rolling updates, elastic scaling, and shared compute.
- **Harnesses** — the tooling to build, test, and evaluate agentic AI: the dev sandbox, operations console, TestKit, EvalKit, [spec-driven development](sdk/spec-driven-development.html), infosec controls, and cost management.
This page looks under the hood at how those layers execute your application. The defining idea is *unified data and logic*. Instead of splitting an application into stateless services on one side and databases on the other, Akka collocates state with the code that owns it. Each component encapsulates its own state and behavior, so the application itself becomes the system of record. That collocation removes a class of coordination, serialization, and latency overhead that dominates traditional service-plus-database designs.

## <a href="about:blank#_execution_patterns"></a> Execution patterns

Agentic workloads rarely fit a single request/response shape. Akka is built around three execution patterns that can be combined in one system.

Long-lived processes Multi-step agents and workflows that run for seconds to days. They persist state through snapshots and change events, so they can pause, resume, or recover without losing context, even as they move across distributed infrastructure.

Transactional processes Lightweight, isolated units of execution, each maintaining its own state. Because there is no shared bottleneck, they process work in a fast, parallel, and elastic way.

Continuous processes High-throughput, low-latency data flows such as audio and video streams or sensor telemetry, handled with built-in flow control so producers cannot overwhelm consumers.

## <a href="about:blank#_the_event_driven_runtime"></a> The event-driven runtime

Underneath every Akka service is an event-driven runtime that handles messaging, persistence, and coordination so you do not implement these patterns by hand.

Asynchronous messaging Components communicate through non-blocking message passing. Producers are decoupled from consumers, and components react when events arrive rather than blocking while they wait.

Event sourcing Every meaningful change is captured as an entry in a durable log that can be replayed. This yields audit trails, temporal debugging, and robust recovery: state can be rebuilt by replaying events, optionally starting from a snapshot.

Distributed coordination Calls to external systems such as APIs, databases, and other agents are made asynchronously and guarded with circuit breakers, retries with backoff, and supervision. Failures stay isolated and recoverable instead of cascading.

### <a href="about:blank#_in_memory_durable_state"></a> In-memory durable state

Akka keeps active state in memory for low-latency access while durably recording every change as snapshots and events. The runtime, not you, manages that durable log and the infrastructure behind it. If a process or node is lost, state is reconstructed automatically from its events. That is auto-recovery, no manual intervention required.

## <a href="about:blank#_scaling_from_zero_to_many_and_back"></a> Scaling from zero to many and back

An Akka service embeds a distributed runtime, so a single service can scale elastically without a separate orchestration layer bolted on. Scaling happens along several dimensions at once.

Sharding Application data is partitioned across durable nodes, and requests are routed automatically to the node that owns the relevant state.

Rebalancing As the cluster grows or shrinks, shards are redistributed across nodes to keep load even.

Query elasticity Read-side queries can be offloaded to separate compute, so the write side and the read side scale independently of each other.

Location transparency Self-contained components recover through event sourcing and can relocate across the cluster. Callers address them by identity, not by physical location, so the runtime is free to move work to reduce latency.

For write-heavy workloads, Akka supports multiple read-write instances using eventual consistency and CRDT techniques. Concurrent modifications converge automatically, much like collaborative editing in a shared document but for application data.

## <a href="about:blank#_clustering_across_clouds"></a> Clustering across clouds

Akka nodes form a self-organizing cluster with no primary node. There is no central coordinator to become a bottleneck or a single point of failure. Nodes communicate over brokerless, encrypted gRPC messaging, and built-in split-brain resolution keeps the cluster consistent when the network partitions. A single cluster can span multiple clouds and data centers, so services run close to their users and their data.

## <a href="about:blank#_a_foundation_of_proven_patterns"></a> A foundation of proven patterns

Rather than asking every team to re-implement distributed systems patterns, Akka embeds them directly into the SDK and runtime. The programming model is grounded in the Reactive Principles: responsiveness, resilience, elasticity, and message-driven design. The guarantees you want become properties of the platform instead of code you have to write and maintain.

## <a href="about:blank#_from_development_to_operations"></a> From development to operations

Akka is a full-stack platform, which means the same model carries a service from your laptop to production:

- **Developer experience** — an SDK and spec-driven workflow for expressing agents, workflows, entities, and views as ordinary code.
- **Runtime** — the event-driven, clustered execution layer that persists state, routes messages, and scales services up and down.
- **Governance and operations** — the controls for deploying, observing, and operating services across environments and regions.
If you are new to the platform, start with the architecture model to see how these pieces fit together, then move into the getting-started guide to build your first service.
