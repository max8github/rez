# Getting started with evaluation

Feature set: Evaluations Contact [our support](https://akka.io/contact) for access.
*This functionality evolves quickly, the behavior and APIs might change between releases without further notice.* An evaluation suite is a set of JUnit tests that run a target service through a set of eval cases and score each reply against what the case expects.
The suite lives alongside the project’s other tests under `src/test/java` and reads the same dependencies at test scope.
An experiment is one class in the suite.
Its outcome is a report the CI job reads for regressions.

## <a href="about:blank#_overview"></a> Overview

An evaluation experiment has four parts.
The **target** is any implementation of `SystemUnderTest`.
For a service on the Akka SDK, the implementation calls the service’s own `ComponentClient`.
The **dataset** is a set of `EvalCase` records.
Each names an eval setup, a graded turn, and the outcome the target is expected to reach.
The **experiment** is a JUnit test class that assembles the dataset and the target, invokes `ExperimentRunner.run(…​)`, and asserts against the result.
The **runner** in `evalkit` walks every eval case in parallel lanes and returns an `ExperimentRunner.Result` carrying what each attempt produced.

The suite is a test scope dependency, so a customer’s production artifact carries no evalkit code.
Experiments are gated on `-Deval=true` so `mvn verify` compiles the classes without running them. `mvn verify -Deval=true` runs them.

## <a href="about:blank#_add_the_dependency"></a> Add the dependency

`akka eval init` overlays the source tree onto the project, edits the pom to add the `evalkit` dependency at test scope, and reports what it wrote.

$ akka eval init
kept   src/test/java/com/acme/checkout/eval/evaluator/deterministic/package-info.java
added the evalkit dependency to pom.xml (previous kept as pom.xml.backup)
run an experiment with `mvn verify -Deval=true`

Added the eval source root to . under package com.acme.checkout.eval — 7 file(s) written, 0 kept. The command is idempotent.
Running it again on a project that already declares the dependency reports "already declares" rather than editing the pom a second time.
A file the customer has since written stays untouched, and the command reports each as `kept`.

The eval tree lands under `src/test/java/<groupId>.eval/`, where `<groupId>` comes from the project’s `pom.xml`.

TIP Alternatively: Add the EvalKit to in the `dependencies` section in your Akka SDK project’s Maven `pom.xml` file.


```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.akka</groupId>
      <artifactId>akka-javasdk-evalkit</artifactId>
      <version>${evalkit.version}</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

## <a href="about:blank#_the_target_adapter"></a> The target adapter

Every experiment talks to one `SystemUnderTest`.
The interface has two responsibilities.
Put the service into the state the eval case names, then submit the graded turn.
For an Akka SDK service, the implementation calls the service’s own `ComponentClient`.
That is the same client an integration test would use.

RefundAgentRunner.java
```java
public class RefundAgentRunner implements SystemUnderTest {

  private final ComponentClient componentClient; // (1)

  public RefundAgentRunner(ComponentClient componentClient) {
    this.componentClient = componentClient;
  }

  @Override
  public Prepared prepare(EvalSetup setup) { // (2)
    if (setup instanceof EvalSetup.Fixture fixture && fixture.name().equals("signed-in")) {
      String sessionId = componentClient
        .forKeyValueEntity("session-42")
        .method(RefundSessionEntity::signIn)
        .invoke();
      return new Prepared.Ready(sessionId, "");
    }
    return new Prepared.Failed(setup + " cannot be arranged"); // (3)
  }

  @Override
  public Reply submit(String sessionId, String userText) { // (4)
    String answer = componentClient
      .forAgent()
      .inSession(sessionId)
      .method(RefundAgent::respond)
      .invoke(userText);
    return Reply.of(answer);
  }

  @Override
  public Map<String, String> fixtures() { // (5)
    return Map.of("signed-in", "a signed-in customer session");
  }
}
```

| **1** | The `ComponentClient` is injected the same way a service’s integration tests receive it. |
| **2** | `prepare(EvalSetup)` arranges the state an eval case names.
A fixture named `"signed-in"` in the eval case reads the fixture handler here. |
| **3** | An eval setup this adapter cannot arrange returns `Prepared.Failed`.
The runner records this as `NotReached`, a fact about the adapter, not a verdict on the target. |
| **4** | `submit(sessionId, userText)` speaks the graded turn.
For an Agent, that is a `.forAgent().inSession(…​).method(…​).invoke(…​)` call. |
| **5** | `fixtures()` declares the states the adapter can reach.
An experiment that names a fixture this adapter never declared is refused before running. |

## <a href="about:blank#_the_experiment_class"></a> The experiment class

An experiment assembles the eval cases and the target, invokes the runner, and asserts against the result.
JUnit reads the class the same way it reads any other test.

RefundPolicyExperiment.java
```java
@EnabledIfSystemProperty(named = "eval", matches = "true") // (1)
public class RefundPolicyExperiment {

  @Test
  void refundPolicyHoldsUp() {
    var cases = List.of( // (2)
      new EvalCase(
        "refund-timing",
        Optional.empty(),
        EvalSetup.Fixture.named("signed-in"),
        "when do I get my refund?",
        "the reply states a 30-day refund window"
      )
    );

    Rubric rubric = Rubrics.load("case-judge", 3);
    var setup = new ExperimentSetup( // (3)
      "refund-policy",
      cases,
      Lanes.of(2),
      rubric
    );

    SystemUnderTest target = new RefundAgentTarget(); // (4)

    ExperimentRunner.Judge judge = (transcript, r) -> // (5)
      EvaluationResult.scored(
        "case-judge",
        "3",
        EvaluatorKind.JUDGE,
        0.9,
        true,
        "states 30 days"
      );

    var result = ExperimentRunner.run(setup, target, judge); // (6)

    assertThat(result.report().passRate()).isGreaterThan(0.9); // (7)
  }
}
```

| **1** | The system-property gate keeps experiments out of `mvn verify`.
The test is compiled and JUnit knows it exists.
Execution needs `-Deval=true`. |
| **2** | Every eval case names an id, an eval setup, the graded turn, and the outcome the target is expected to reach. |
| **3** | The experiment setup collects the cases, sets the number of parallel lanes, and names the rubric an agentic evaluator would use. |
| **4** | The adapter from the previous section. |
| **5** | The judge settles the eval cases that name neither a specification node nor a metric. |
| **6** | `ExperimentRunner.run(…​)` walks every case, calls the adapter, scores each attempt, and returns an `ExperimentRunner.Result`. |
| **7** | The result carries no assertions of its own, so the experiment asserts the way any JUnit test does. |

## <a href="about:blank#_what_a_run_reports"></a> What a run reports

`mvn verify -Deval=true` runs the experiment. `Panels.render(result.asRecord(setup, reporting))` returns the report as a `String`.
The experiment writes it wherever the project keeps them.
The report is plain 80-column ASCII and prints between four and seven panels in a fixed
order.
Four always appear.
Three only when the run has something to put in them.
The numbering starts at 1 with no gaps.

The example below is the report a single-run refund-policy experiment produces (`Panels.render()` output from a six-case fixture with two passes, two failures, one undecided, and one no-result):

Refund policy evaluation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  run      2026-08-11T09:14Z           system   claims-svc 4.2.0
  rules    refund-desk v3              rubric   case-judge v3
  scope    6 cases, 6 attempts
  record   target/evalkit/refund-policy.jsonl
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1  What the run found
---------------------

  passed            #############                               2
  failed            #############                               2
  undecided         #######                                     1
  no result         #######                                     1

  In this run, each case ran once. Undecided means that a result was in
  a judge's middle confidence. No result means the run stopped before there
  was an answer to score.

  One attempt cannot tell a case the system meets from one it happened to
  meet. Five attempts would show a case holds at least 55% of the time,
  twenty attempts at least 86%, fifty at least 94%.

2  What failed
--------------

     refund-14d            expected GenUC-16a, found GenUC-17a
     tool-scope            tool-permission v1: scored 0.50, needed 1.00

  Every case that failed, and what the evaluator said about it. An evaluator
  that computes a number reports the number it got and the number it needed.

3  How quality was measured
---------------------------

           # passed   x failed   ~ varied   ? unsettled

     specification node      #########xxxxxxxxx             2
     case judge              #########?????????????????     3
     tool permission         xxxxxxxxx                      1
     ...
     (rows for every measure the run touched, plus zeros for those it did not)

4  How the judge scored
-----------------------

     10                                        0
      9  ##############################        1
      8                                        0
     ..... passed, 8 and above .................... 1
      7                                        0
      6                                        0
      5  ##############################        1
      4                                        0
     ..... undecided, 4 to 7 ...................... 1
      3                                        0
      2                                        0
      1                                        0
     ..... failed, 3 and below .................... 0

  Models scored 3 cases from 1 to 10, with 10 being very confident.

5  What this run cannot tell you
--------------------------------

  These attempts stopped before the system produced an answer to score.

     never reached the question                    0
     no reply within 45 seconds                    1
     the judge would not score the answer          0

6  What it cost
---------------

     the system under test            70,000 in     4,000 out
     the judge                         7,628 in       948 out
     total                            77,628 in     4,948 out

  Tokens the system and the judge sent and received across all 6 attempts.

     under 5s      ##########################    2
     5 to 15s      #############                 1
     15 to 30s                                   0
     30 to 45s     #############                 1
     over 45s      #############                 1

  How long the system took to answer, over 5 attempts. Panels shown here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
A run with `repeating(N > 1)` and any varied verdict inserts panel 3 as "The cases that gave different answers between attempts", and everything after it renumbers.
A run without any judged case leaves out "How the judge scored".

For every panel and how each column composes, see [Reports](reports.html).
