# Baselines and regression

Feature set: Evaluations Contact [our support](https://akka.io/contact) for access.
*This functionality evolves quickly, the behavior and APIs might change between releases without further notice.* A baseline is a saved reference run that later runs compare against.
Committing a baseline is how a project states "this is the target’s known-good behaviour".
Comparing against it is how CI catches a regression before the change ships.
The baseline file itself is the audit trail.
Whoever approved the promotion is whoever signed off on the commit.

## <a href="about:blank#_how_an_experiment_compares_against_a_baseline"></a> How an experiment compares against a baseline

`akka.evalkit.core.domain.Scoring.compare(ExperimentReport, ExperimentReport)` reads two
reports and returns the per-case deltas the experiment asserts against.
An experiment that wants a comparison loads its baseline file, runs the current experiment, and
calls `Scoring.compare` on the two reports.

## <a href="about:blank#_where_baselines_live"></a> Where baselines live

`src/test/resources/eval/baselines/<experiment-name>.json`

Commit baselines to source control.
They are the record against which regressions are measured, and the commit is the audit trail for a promotion.

## <a href="about:blank#_convention"></a> Convention

**One baseline per experiment name.** A `nightly-refund-policy.json` file is the baseline for a run named `nightly-refund-policy`.
A recurring experiment has one file that gets replaced on approval.
A one-off exploratory experiment has no baseline at all.

**Never edit a baseline in place.** A baseline names the rubric version and the ruleset version it was produced under.
Editing it silently redefines what a comparison compares to.
Replace the file whole on approval, and let the commit be the audit trail.

**A comparison refuses across version changes.** A current run against a rubric or ruleset newer than the baseline is a version mismatch, not movement in the target.
The experiment checks the versions before calling `Scoring.compare` and refuses the comparison when either differs.

## <a href="about:blank#_approving_a_new_baseline"></a> Approving a new baseline

Approval is an explicit step outside the experiment.
An experiment that promoted its own baseline would let a bad run overwrite the reference it was meant to be judged against.
That is the opposite of what a baseline is for.

After an experiment holds against its baseline for long enough to trust the new numbers, the person approving copies the rendered report from `target/evalkit/` into the baselines directory and commits:

cp target/evalkit/refund-policy-20260821T0914Z.json \
   src/test/resources/eval/baselines/nightly-refund-policy.json
git add src/test/resources/eval/baselines/nightly-refund-policy.json
git commit -m "baseline: promote refund-policy run 2026-08-21T09:14Z" The commit is the audit trail.
Whoever approves is whoever signed off on the promotion. `target/test-classes/`, regenerated on every build, is deliberately not where a baseline lives.

## <a href="about:blank#_best_practices"></a> Best practices

- Update the baseline whenever an intentional behavior change lands.
- Do not update the baseline on the same commit that changes the target.
Land the target change, review the report by hand, then land the baseline change.
- Keep the baseline file small enough to review in a code review.
A baseline the reviewer cannot read is a baseline the reviewer cannot approve.
