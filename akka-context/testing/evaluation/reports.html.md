# Reports

Feature set: Evaluations Contact [our support](https://akka.io/contact) for access.
*This functionality evolves quickly, the behavior and APIs might change between releases without further notice.* `Panels.render(RunRecord)` returns a plain 80-column ASCII report as a `String`.
Where it is written is the caller’s choice.
See [Experiments and runs](experiments.html) for turning a run into the record it renders from.
The report prints a header followed by the panels the run has content for, numbered in the
order they appear.
Four always print: what the run found, how quality was measured, what it cannot tell you,
and what it cost.
Three are conditional.
A panel with nothing to say is left out with the numbering closing the gap: the failed panel when any eval case failed, the varied panel when `repeating(N > 1)` produced a varied verdict, and the judge panel when anything was judged.

"What it cannot tell you" always prints, including when it has nothing to report. A report
that silently omitted its own limits would read as a report with none.

Every example below is the exact byte output the tool produces.

## <a href="about:blank#_header"></a> Header

Always at the top of the report.
Carries the run identity, the target build, the ruleset version, the rubric version, the scope and the record path.

Refund policy evaluation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  run      2026-08-11T09:14Z           system   claims-svc 4.2.0
  rules    refund-desk v3              rubric   case-judge v3
  scope    6 cases, 6 attempts
  record   target/evalkit/refund-policy.jsonl
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## <a href="about:blank#_panel_1_what_the_run_found"></a> Panel 1: What the run found

Total cases, broken down by verdict.
Always appears.

1  What the run found
---------------------

  passed            #############                               2
  failed            #############                               2
  undecided         #######                                     1
  no result         #######                                     1

  In this run, each case ran once. Undecided means that a result was in
  a judge's middle confidence. No result means the run stopped before there
  was an answer to score.

  One attempt cannot tell a case the system meets from one it happened to
  meet. Five attempts would show a case holds at least 55% of the time,
  twenty attempts at least 86%, fifty at least 94%. When `repeating(N > 1)` runs the same case N times, the labels read `passed every attempt` and `failed every attempt`, and a `varied` row appears above `undecided`.

## <a href="about:blank#_panel_2_what_failed"></a> Panel 2: What failed

Every failing case, listed one per line with the id and the evaluator’s own reason.
Appears only when any case failed.

2  What failed
--------------

     refund-14d            expected GenUC-16a, found GenUC-17a
     tool-scope            tool-permission v1: scored 0.50, needed 1.00

  Every case that failed, and what the evaluator said about it. An evaluator
  that computes a number reports the number it got and the number it needed.
## <a href="about:blank#_panel_3_the_cases_that_gave_different_answers_between_attempts"></a> Panel 3: The cases that gave different answers between attempts

Appears only when `repeating(N > 1)` produced any varied verdict.
Each varied case shows a fixed-width attempt strip: `+` for an attempt that passed, `-` for one that failed, in the order they were started.

3  The cases that gave different answers between attempts
---------------------------------------------------------

  There was 1 varied case.

     case                + passed   - failed  settled by            attempts passed
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     flaky               + - + - +            specification node          3 of 5

  Each mark is one attempt, in the order they were started.

  A case settled by comparison that varies means the system is giving
  different answers to the same question. At larger repeat counts each mark covers several attempts (`+` when more than half of them passed) so the column stays the same width from 5 attempts to 500.

## <a href="about:blank#_panel_4_how_quality_was_measured"></a> Panel 4: How quality was measured

One row per quality measure the experiment shipped, with a stacked bar of `#` / `x` / `~` / `?` glyphs showing how each measure fared.

4  How quality was measured
---------------------------

           # passed   x failed   ~ varied   ? unsettled

     specification node      #########xxxxxxxxx             2
     case judge              #########?????????????????     3

     citation faithfulness                                  0
     turn relevancy                                         0
     plan quality                                           0
     plan adherence                                         0
     step efficiency                                        0

  Quality measures are specific to the use case being executed. Counts reflect
  the number of cases a quality measure checked. Varied means the same
  case got a different verdict on different attempts. Unsettled means the
  judge was undecided or the attempt produced nothing. A measure the experiment never touched still prints as a zero row.
The panel is a full inventory, so nothing gets missed by omission.

## <a href="about:blank#_panel_5_how_the_judge_scored"></a> Panel 5: How the judge scored

Appears only when any case was judged.
Prints a horizontal bar of `#` glyphs per score from 10 down to 1, grouped into three bands the rubric declares.

5  How the judge scored
-----------------------

     10                                        0
      9  ##############################        1
      8                                        0
     ..... passed, 8 and above .................... 1
      7                                        0
      6                                        0
      5  ##############################        1
      4                                        0
     ..... undecided, 4 to 7 ...................... 1
      3                                        0
      2                                        0
      1                                        0
     ..... failed, 3 and below .................... 0

  Models scored 3 cases from 1 to 10, with 10 being very confident.

  The judge agrees with a human reviewer 89-91% of the time on clear-cut
  replies and 53% of the time on borderline ones.
## <a href="about:blank#_panel_6_what_this_run_cannot_tell_you"></a> Panel 6: What this run cannot tell you

Attempts that stopped before the system produced an answer, split by cause.
Also lists any cases the coverage declaration excluded from this run.

6  What this run cannot tell you
--------------------------------

  These attempts stopped before the system produced an answer to score.

     never reached the question                    0
     no reply within 45 seconds                    1
     the judge would not score the answer          0

  These cases were left out of this run.

     booking changes                               14

  This kit can show that the system answered correctly from a stated starting
  point. It cannot show that a user reaches that point unaided.
## <a href="about:blank#_panel_7_what_it_cost"></a> Panel 7: What it cost

Token spend split by target and judge, plus a latency distribution across five fixed buckets against the reply timeout.

7  What it cost
---------------

     the system under test            70,000 in     4,000 out
     the judge                         7,628 in       948 out
     total                            77,628 in     4,948 out

  Tokens the system and the judge sent and received across all 6 attempts.

     under 5s      ##########################    2
     5 to 15s      #############                 1
     15 to 30s                                   0
     30 to 45s     #############                 1
     over 45s      #############                 1

  How long the system took to answer, over 5 attempts. 1 came within 15 seconds of
  the 45 second timeout and 1 exceeded it, which is counted as no reply. Attempts
  were executed 4 at a time, so these times include waiting for a free lane. If any model call did not report its token usage, the panel appends: *"N model replies carried no usage figure, so these totals are a floor rather than a measurement."*
