# Concepts and vocabulary

Feature set: Evaluations Contact [our support](https://akka.io/contact) for access.
*This functionality evolves quickly, the behavior and APIs might change between releases without further notice.* Six terms do most of the work.

`EvalCase` One thing to test. A graded turn, what a correct answer does, an optional expectation (specification node, required phrases, or metric), and the state the system should be in before the turn.

`SystemUnderTest` The service being evaluated. Two methods: `prepare(EvalSetup)` puts it into the state a case names; `submit(sessionId, userText)` speaks the graded turn.

`Evaluator` A check over one recorded attempt. Reads an `EvaluationContext` and returns an `EvaluationResult`. Three families ship: deterministic, heuristic, agentic.

`ExperimentSetup` A named set of eval cases plus the rubric, lanes, policy, and repeat count. What to run.

`ExperimentRunner` Walks the setup, calls the adapter, hands each attempt to an evaluator, and returns one `EvalCaseResults` per case plus an `ExperimentReport` counting the whole run.

Experiment class Your JUnit test class that assembles the pieces above and calls `ExperimentRunner.run(…​)`. A convention, not an SDK type. Named `*Experiment.java` by convention, gated on `-Deval=true`.

## <a href="about:blank#_authoring_what_to_implement"></a> Authoring: What to implement

An eval case names the state, the turn, and the correct answer.
It is a Java record and lives in your suite. evalkit ships no on-disk format.
An eval setup (`None`, `Replay`, `Fixture`, `FailingTool`) says how the system reaches the state before the graded turn.
A `SystemUnderTest` implementation reaches the service over its `ComponentClient` for an Akka SDK service, or over HTTP for a service in another runtime.

An experiment setup collects the cases, the parallel lane count, the rubric a judge would score against, and the policy the run happened under.
Two runs under different rules are not comparable, and the policy is what makes that visible.

## <a href="about:blank#_running_what_the_runner_produces"></a> Running: What the runner produces

The runner walks the cases in parallel lanes.
For each attempt it builds an `EvalContext` from what the adapter recorded (the interaction, the input, and what was expected), calls `context.asContext()` to hand a shared `EvaluationContext` to the right evaluator, and records the returned `EvaluationResult`.

Which evaluator settles a case follows from what the case declares. `EvaluatorRouter.byExpectation` sends a case naming a specification node to comparison, a case naming required phrases to `ContainsAll`, a case naming a metric to that metric, and everything else to the judge.

## <a href="about:blank#_reading_results"></a> Reading results

Every attempt returns an `EvaluationResult` carrying one `EvaluationOutcome`:

`VERDICT` The evaluator called it. Passed or failed, with an optional score.

`UNDECIDED` The evaluator read the answer and declined to call it. Carries the score it declined at.

`INCONCLUSIVE` Nothing to read. Not a statement about the target.

`FAILED` The evaluator itself broke.

Attempts group into `EvalCaseResults`, one per case. `EvalCaseResults.verdict()` collapses the attempts into one of five values the report reads by: `PASSED`, `FAILED`, `VARIED`, `UNDECIDED`, `NO_RESULT`. `VARIED` is the reason to repeat.
A case that passes eight times in ten still passes five attempts about a third of the time, and one attempt cannot tell that apart from a case that always passes.

`ExperimentReport` counts what happened across all attempts and answers `passRate()`.

| Term | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `EvalCase` | One thing to test. Java record. |
| `EvalSetup` | How the system reaches the state before the graded turn. |
| `SystemUnderTest` | Your adapter to the service. |
| `EvalContext` | Everything an evaluator reads about one attempt. |
| `Evaluator` | The check. Returns an `EvaluationResult`. |
| `EvaluationResult` | The outcome of one evaluation. |
| `EvaluationOutcome` | Enum: `VERDICT`, `UNDECIDED`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, `FAILED`. |
| `Grade` | A judge’s 1-to-10 helper, and the parse that reads it. |
| `Rubric` | Versioned prompt a judge measures against. |
| Judge | A model asked to score what has no right answer to compare against. |
| `ExperimentSetup` | Named cases + rubric + lanes + policy + repeats. |
| `ExperimentRunner` | Walks the setup, produces `EvalCaseResults` and an `ExperimentReport`. |
| `ExperimentReport` | Counts, pass rate, trustworthiness flags. |
| `EvalCaseResults` | One case together with every attempt of it. |
| Attempt | One check of one case. A case checked three times produces three attempts. |
| Experiment class | Your JUnit test class. Convention, not an SDK type. |
| `RemoteCampaign` | Wire client for dispatching a run to the offline-evals service. (SDK class name kept from nexus 0.1.0.) |
| `Policy` | The rules the system was given while the run happened. |
| `Lanes` | Parallel-worker count for the runner. |
