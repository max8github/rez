# Experiments and runs

Feature set: Evaluations Contact [our support](https://akka.io/contact) for access.
*This functionality evolves quickly, the behavior and APIs might change between releases without further notice.* An experiment is a named set of eval cases that runs together against one target.
A run is one execution of it.
Each eval case becomes one `EvalCaseResults` in the result, carrying every attempt of that
case.
The report is rendered from those results rather than stored beside them.

## <a href="about:blank#_the_experiment_setup"></a> The experiment setup

`ExperimentSetup` is a record. Build it with its constructor, then two methods return a
setup with one thing changed.

```java
var setup = new ExperimentSetup(
        "refund-flow",                          // (1)
        cases,                                  // (2)
        Lanes.of(4),                            // (3)
        Rubric.load("case-judge", 3))           // (4)
    .under(Policy.load("refund-desk", 1))       // (5)
    .repeating(3);                              // (6)
```

| **1** | The name is the stable key reports and baselines join on.
Lowercase, hyphen-separated by convention. |
| **2** | A `List<EvalCase>`.
Read them from wherever the project keeps them. `EvalSource` is the interface for paging a large set, and a project supplies its own implementation. |
| **3** | How many cases run at once. See [Lanes](about:blank#_lanes). |
| **4** | The rubric the judge scores against, loaded from `eval/rubrics/case-judge-v3.txt` on the classpath. |
| **5** | `under(Policy)` records the rules the system was given.
Two runs under different rules are not comparable, and a reader cannot see that from the
numbers. |
| **6** | `repeating(N)` runs each eval case `N` times.
One attempt cannot tell a case the system meets from one it happened to meet.
A case the system handles eight times in ten still passes five attempts about a third of
the time. |
A setup is checked before it runs. `setup.check(target)` returns `Check.Ready` or `Check.Refused` carrying the reasons.
An experiment naming a fixture the target cannot build is refused in seconds rather than yielding one `NotReached` per case at the end of a long run.

## <a href="about:blank#_running_an_experiment"></a> Running an experiment

Local runs are ordinary JUnit tests gated on `-Deval=true`. `mvn verify -Deval=true` walks every experiment class under `src/test/java/<pkg>/eval/`.

```java
var result = ExperimentRunner.run(setup, target, judge);
```
`ExperimentRunner.Result` carries the counts in `report()`, what the lanes sustained in `utilisation()`, one row per attempt in `completed()`, those rows grouped by eval case in `cases()`, and anything the run needs to say in `notes()`.

To render the report, turn the result into the record a report is made from and print it.
The run counts the cases, the policy, the lane count and the system’s own spend. `Reporting` carries what the run cannot know about itself, such as what it is called and
how far the judge can be relied on.

```java
var record = result.asRecord(setup, reporting);
Files.writeString(Path.of("target/evalkit/refund-flow.txt"), Panels.render(record));
```
Where the report is written is the caller’s choice. Nothing writes one on its own.

For dispatching an experiment to a running evaluation service instead of running it in-process, see [Remote experiments](remote-experiments.html).

## <a href="about:blank#_lanes"></a> Lanes

A lane is a worker. `Lanes.of(4)` runs four eval cases at once, over a shared queue rather
than a fixed split.
Transcripts vary from a couple of messages to eighty, and an unlucky
partition leaves one worker running long after the rest are idle.

The configured number is not the interesting one. Akka will run thousands of these without
noticing.
The model provider will not. `result.utilisation()` reports what the run actually
sustained against what was asked for.
That separates "we asked for 64" from "we sustained 9 because we were being throttled".

The ceiling is 512, and it is not an Akka limit. A number that high against a rate-limited
provider produces a queue of failing calls rather than throughput.

## <a href="about:blank#_fixtures"></a> Fixtures

An eval case names the state it needs through its `EvalSetup`: `None`, a `Replay` of earlier
turns, a `Fixture` the target builds, or a `FailingTool`. The target declares what it can
build in `SystemUnderTest.fixtures()`, with a one-line description of each.
Only the code that builds "authenticated with a claim open" knows what that contains.

An experiment setup naming a fixture the target never declared is refused by `setup.check(target)` before anything runs.

## <a href="about:blank#_recording_and_re_scoring"></a> Recording and re-scoring

`FileLedger` reads and writes interaction records in a directory. `FileLedger.save` writes
one. `RecordedInteractions` is a target that reads them back and calls nothing.

An experiment over `RecordedInteractions` scores runs evalkit did not execute.
A dataset scored in CI and traffic scored in production reach the same report through the same
metrics. The same recording can be scored again under a new evaluator or a new rubric
without paying the target twice.

Nothing is recorded automatically. `ExperimentRunner` does not touch a ledger.
A project that wants a recording writes one.

## <a href="about:blank#_failing_a_build_on_the_result"></a> Failing a build on the result

`ExperimentRunner.Result` carries no assertions. An experiment is a JUnit test, so it asserts
with whatever the project already uses.

```java
assertThat(result.report().passRate()).isGreaterThan(0.9);
```
`ExperimentReport` counts passed, review and failed attempts and answers `passRate()`.
It also says when it will not stand behind a figure. `provesAnyReachability()` is false
when every attempt started from a seeded state, and `isTrustworthy()` is false when too
little was measured to read a rate from.

For comparing a run against an earlier one, see [Baselines and regression](baselines.html).

## <a href="about:blank#_best_practices"></a> Best practices

- Give each experiment a stable, lowercase, hyphen-separated name.
The name is the key reports, baselines, and CI dashboards join on.
- Use `repeating(3)` for experiments that use agentic evaluators.
Model calls sample. Three repeats stabilise most verdicts and let the variance panel read the flips.
- State a policy on every experiment with `under(…​)`, so a policy change reads as a policy change in the report and not as a target change.
- Keep the eval case count per experiment small enough that a local run finishes quickly.
Long-running experiments belong on the offline-evals service.
